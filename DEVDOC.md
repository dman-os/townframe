### 2024-03-05 | Proc macros

Spent today porting glue code from the aggy codebase.
Cleaned up some of the boilerplates due to new proc macros.
I had an LLM write it for me.
Well, it certainly helped anyways.
Next time, I'll have to setup the db stuff.
Can't wait to start on actual feature work lol.

### 2024-03-04 | Ramping up

Trying to get the show on the road.
This is a full stack project in the traditional sense.
I'll need to write a web app, backend API and possibly a mobile app.
I'll be starting out with Granary which seems doable.
