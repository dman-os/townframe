- Don't be lazy with solutions.
- Don't catch or log errors every edgecase.
  - Most errors are programming errors and should crash the program.
  - Errors that should be handled include
    - Network errors
    - User input validation
  - Don't swallow errors with empty catch statements or catch-and-log unless explcitly told to do so.
- To type check and lint the ./src/daybook_compose multiplatform app, use `ghjk x check-dayb`.
- Prefer `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -p myCrate` over `cargo check`.
- When working with rust, in addition to `cargo clippy`, small tests can be used to validate ideas.
- Do not use the cargo integration tests features.
  - I.e. avoid making tests in crate_root::tests.
- DHashMaps shouldn't not be used for sync across tasks/threads. 
  - They easily deadlock if modified across multiple tasks.
  - They're only a good fit for single modifier situation where a normal HashMap won't due to do async problems.
- Do not adress TODOs or FIXMEs unless told to do so.
- Prefer to preserve comments unless they are progress comments written by an agent. 
- Don't be lazy with solutions.
- Use RUST_LOG_TEST env var for controlling log levels during testing.
- `printf` and experimental debugging is always quicker than coming up with premature hypothesis.
