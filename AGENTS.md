- To type check and lint the ./src/daybook_compose multiplatform app, use `ghjk x check-dayb`.
- Prefer `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -p myCrate`.
- Avoid being lazy with solutions.
- Avoid trying to catch the error or log the error for every edgecase.
  - Most errors are programming errors and should crash the application.
  - Errors that should be handled include: network issues, user input validation issues.
  - Don't ever swallow errors with empty catch statemnts or catch-and-log unless explcitly told to do so.
