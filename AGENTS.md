- Don't be lazy with solutions.
- Don't catch or log errors every edgecase.
  - Most errors are programming errors and should crash the program.
  - Errors that should be handled include
    - Network errors
    - User input validation
  - Don't swallow errors with empty catch statements or catch-and-log unless explcitly told to do so.
- To type check and lint the ./src/daybook_compose multiplatform app, use `ghjk x check-dayb`.
- Prefer `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -p myCrate`.
